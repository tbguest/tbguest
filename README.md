# :wave: Hi! Tristan here

I work as a software developer, currently as a contractor for @BiggerPicture. Feel free to explore some of the other projects I've been involved with via my [portfolio site](https://tristanguest.dev/projects) or here on GitHub.

I do most of my work with TypeScript, Node.js, and React, usually with Next.js. Right now I'm particularly keen on full-stack TypeScript with tRPC and the T3 stack. I also work with Python sometimes.

I have a PhD in physical oceanography. My [dissertation](https://github.com/tbguest/dissertation) was focused on self-organizing wave-forced patterns on beaches.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristanguest/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tristan_guest). I'd be happy to hear from you!
